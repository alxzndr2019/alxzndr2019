# 👋 Hey there, I’m Alexander (aka @alxzndr2019)

🚀 **Senior Full Stack Engineer | Scalable Systems | Data-Driven Architecture**

I’m a practical engineer passionate about designing and building **high-performance, distributed applications** — from modern frontend experiences to backend systems built for scale. My focus areas include:

- 🧩 **Full Stack Development:** React, Next.js, Node.js, Go, TypeScript  
- ⚙️ **System Design & Infrastructure:** AWS (Lambda, EC2, S3), Terraform, Docker, CI/CD  
- 📡 **Data & Event Streaming:** Kafka, Redis, Postgres, event-driven architecture  
- 🧠 **AI & Automation:** Integrating LLMs into developer workflows and learning systems  

I love building things from scratch — from API-as-a-service platforms to intelligent data pipelines — and sharing what I learn along the way.

### 🧱 Current Focus
- Architecting **real-time data streaming** pipelines with Kafka  
- Exploring **serverless + event-driven** application patterns  
- Building **AI-powered developer tools** that learn from usage patterns
